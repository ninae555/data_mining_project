As a gift, I’ve offered to repair/restore the existing iron fence in kind in his front yard. The existing fence is rusty and needs paint. The front gate has broken at one hinge and it needs repair. There is a picket and finial missing and other finials are bent. After speaking with Mr. Mitchell at DDOT, he told me that the existing fence is on public space and that I need this permit. We aren’t constructing anything but simply repairing/restoring the existing fence in kind. I’ve  hired local contractor Banks B. Banks to do the work once we receive the permit. Mr. Banks will sand the rust, paint the fence black, which is the current color, repair the front gate, replace the picket and finial to match the existing pickets and finials, and straighten any bent pickets and finials. He will restore the existing iron fence to its original luster. Although I entered a 3/13/23 work start date, the repair work is done outdoors and it is weather dependent so the time window may change somewhat based on the weather.

      Thank you for taking the time to assess my proposal for a new driveway and curb cut.  After careful reading of your responses to the original proposed driveway location on 45th St., I have revised the site plan with a new proposed driveway location on Eads St., which addresses and resolves all of your concerns, as well as my own concern for the danger of installing a driveway on a steep slope.

      Reviewer Concern 1: The original location of the driveway is 19 feet from a special tree.  The new location is 40 feet from this tree.  Moreover, all other trees are located more than 12 feet from the driveway at this new location.

      Reviewer Concern 2: In the original driveway location, the parked car would have to straddle the building restriction line.  The new location allows for the car to be parked within the building restriction line.

      Reviewer Concern 3: The original driveway location is less than 60 feet from the intersection.  The new location is 64.5 feet from the intersection.

      My Concerns about Some Reviewer’s Suggestion of a Revised Location on 45th St. at the Rear of the Property:  Similar to the ground adjacent to the alley, this suggested revised location on 45th St. has an average grade of 36%, which is unsafe, impractical, and will cause undue hardship.  (See new pictures.) Moreover, this location would be problematic because of the guy wire and trees in that area.  The new proposed driveway location off of Eads St. is on flat ground.  (See new pictures.)

      To further support the revised location off of Eads St., please note that there is already an existing curb cut, creating a 7-foot wide driveway entrance, which suggests to me that either a driveway existed here before I bought this home 12 years ago, or was cut for a future driveway to be installed.  I would only need to cut an addition 3 feet of the curb on one side to accommodate a 10-foot wide driveway.

      Perhaps it should also be to noted that although my next door neighbor has an asphalt apron outside their property, they no longer have a driveway on their property.  (See new pictures.)

      And regarding an erosion and sediment control site plan, since the amount for the best reputable contractor quote I obtained for the curb cut and driveway installation is under $9,822.29 (i.e., approximately $7,000), my understanding is that an erosion and sediment control site plan is not required.

      Finally, please understand the great importance of installing this driveway:  Because of some substantial DC, federal, and car dealership price reductions, rebates, and financial incentives, my wife and I are in the process of purchasing an electric car.  And because of the short length of a level 2 charging cable, in order to charge the car battery, the car will have to be parked close to the house.  We are a low income couple, and with the recent electrical upgrade rebates and incentives, this plan will be the most economical option.",2022/09/27 21:19:36+00,N/A,38.89516002,-76.93752074,,{F754EAA4-0971-3AB7-E053-792F520A367A},,,,
